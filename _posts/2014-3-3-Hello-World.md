## Oakview Ridge...
### is the name I have decided on, at least temporarily.

You're thinking, _another_ Stardew Valley clone? _Another_ Harvest Moon ripoff? 
You're damn right!!!  

I've been working on the project for about two days now, mostly trying to figure out where I want to take it and how I should go about things, and in this time I have done a few things. So far, I've made three songs, some basic sprites, and I have started piecing together a story. I really want to make this thing my own, and not just be another "ripoff" game, and that's what I'm going to try damn well hard to do. I've got some ideas brewing, you just wait.
